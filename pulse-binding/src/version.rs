//! Version constants and functions
//!
//! The constants defined here follow those given in the `sys` crate and thus the C headers.
//!
//! - They are typically updated only following a new major release of PA.
//! - They are not typically updated following a new minor release of PA. i.e. we may declare
//!   version `12.0` here, but remain compatible with all `12.x`, so long as PA itself continues to
//!   adhere to semantic versioning (i.e. no breaking changes in minor releases).
//! - They are **not** the minimum compatible PA version. We have feature flags for providing
//!   backwards compatibility with a limited number of past major versions.
//!
//! Currently:
//!
//! - We primarily target PA version `12.x`
//! - We have backwards compatibility with PA version `11.x` (and it is believed `10.x`) if the
//!   `pa_encoding_from_string` feature flag is disabled.
//!
//! When feature flags are used for backwards compatibility, the versions defined here (as of
//! version `2.3`) are adjusted to return the newest compatible major version.
//!
//! The `get_library_version` function always obtains at runtime the version of the actual PA
//! library in use.
